# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

In order to run this project you must have the following in your computer:

- Node.js v8+
- PostgreSQL (Running on default port 5432)

## Installing

**Installing dependencies**

```
$ yarn
```

_or_

```
$ npm install
```

**Docker Containers**

- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) or another setted Postgres service

First, you need to create a **.env** file in root of application. The structure of this file is similar to the **.env.example** file, just copy and put the correct informations for all variables.

### Setting database with docker compose

#### Starting postgres service with docker compose

If you dont have postgres service installed localy, you can install it with **docker compose**:

```
  ~ docker-compose up -d
```

The postgres container will be created with a user and password setted in **.env** file.

If you try create postgres service with docker compose with a local postgres service running, you will receive a error because the service is already running in the local port 5432.

You can stop postgres service in Mac with the command:

```
  ~ sudo -u postgres ./pg_ctl -D /your/data/directory/path stop
```

#### Creating and configurating database

```
  ~ yarn typeorm:migration:run
  ~ yarn typeorm:seed:run
```

_or_

```
  ~ npm run typeorm:migration:run
  ~ npm run typeorm:seed:run
```
